PROBLEM DEFINITION: Here we difined the problem which we needed to solve using the machine learning algorithms. We want to train the model to be able to predict the patient 
condition and suggest suitable drugs based on the positive and negative reviews. We are concerned on only three conditions namely: Depression,Diabetes Type 2 and High Blood Pressure.

GATHERING AND PREPARING DATA: In this stage, necessary libraries are imported and dataset is loaded using pandas library. We check the missing values by the help info() function then 
impute the missing values. After handling the missing values we checked and handles outliers using interquatile Range (IQR) and then performed statistical computation

FEATURE EXTRACTION: At this step we convert the textual data into numerical representations that can be understood by the machine learning algorithms. We used Bag-of-Words (BoW)
and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) techniques 

SPLITTING DATA: We split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

MODEL SELECTION: Here we compared Naive bayes algorithm and Passive aggressive classifier model to check which one is better. We selected PassiveAggressiveClassifier 
as it was the one performing better

MODEL TRAINING: The training set from splitting data stage is used to train the model.

MODEL EVALUATION: The testing set from splitting data stage is used to assess the accuracy of the model
